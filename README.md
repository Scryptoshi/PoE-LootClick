# PoE-LootFinder
Loot finder for [Path of Exile]

This script will bring the mouse over a piece of loot for you whenever you hit the hotkey! 
It does not automatically "find and collects" the loot. It searched the coordinates on your screen resolution for a pixel color of your choice which you will need to configure. 

By using  any loot filter, you can determine the specific loot that you are after. By configuring the [TEXT] NOT the border or background, has to be the [TEXT] to have the same color, you can narrow down to the loot that you are after.
I have provided the file: [PoE-LootFinder] which will come preconfigured to my color of choice.

You will have the option to change the color of the loot font text and the hotkey you want to use on the [config] file. 


# Getting Started
1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/Scryptoshi/PoE-LootFinder/releases">latest release</a> - [PoE-LootFinder v2.1]

2. Load up the provided [PoE-LootFinder.filter] document to your PoE Filter folder or create your own filter document than add it to the loot filter folder. 
- You can find your filter folder by going to: Options > UI > Show Folder, in your PoE game.  
- You can go to your own or https://www.filterblade.xyz/ to make your personal filter file. 

3. Run PoE-LootFinder.exe
- You are ready to go!

NOTE: To turn off the application you must press the [PAUSE] key on your keyboard or find the icon of the running executable on your taskbar then [Right mouse click] > [Close].
NOTE: The current version was created for 1920x1080 resolution. It may work on other resolutions, but the calibration needs to be done. Check the v2.1 version for the option to modify the coordinates.


# Operation
When the loot you want drops, click your hotkey, the mouse will move to the area where the loot is. Simple. 

The default hotkey is the [X2 mouse button]. Most mouses that have 2 additional side buttons by your thumb, that’s one of those. 
Or you can go to the Config.bat file to change the hotkey. 

- During the fights you are circling the mouse pointer all over the screen targeting different mobs.
- Without this script, you must quickly find your mouse pointer and move over to the loot to then left mouse click to pick up the loot.
- With this script, when you either see the color or hear the sound of your loot droop from your loot finder, you click the hotkey to target the loot and then you can “left mouse” button click to pick it up.

NOTE: It will NOT pick up the item. You still will have to click your left mouse button to pick up the loot. This gives you an option to not pick it up if you do not want to but also prevents in having a fully automated process.  

IMPORTANT: The script moves your mouse positioning, so you must be aware of the environment around you. If the loot is over or under an obstacle you need to relocate to where the character can reach by walking to it. It will take some time for you to understand the process. 
 
# FAQ

# Is it safe to use?
Yes. If you have concerns, look at source code.

# Does this violate Path of Exile's Terms of Service?
Technically this script is not an automated process to scam the game or benefit more from others. It will only allocate your mouse pointer where you want it to be. It could be good or bad. In my view "A function or script exists when it adds or eliminates 1 extra step to facilitate life." What I am doing here is taking one step into problem solving a much-desired action that most PoE players would love to have. This project is the best creative solution I could come up before "automation" is engaged. Ultimately "GGG - Path of Exile" decides. 

# By the way,
- I am not responsible if the use of this script will result in action from Path of Exile. Use at your own risk.
- I would love to have your support and feedback so we can collective continue to take one step forward in solving the taxing task that is to "maps loot handling". 
- This project is made for academic pursuit and I am open to suggestions on how to make it better.
